                        Hailing from the picturesque landscapes of South Africa, my life‚Äôs story has led me to the
                        captivating shores of New
                        Zealand, where I lived for five years, before embracing the vibrance of Australia as my current
                        home.

                        I‚Äôm a 90s kid. ü§ò This means that I grew up amidst wave after wave of exhilarating technological
                        progress, a backdrop
                        that ultimately inspired my journey into the world of Computer Technology as a subject in
                        secondary school, which I
                        enjoyed until graduating. However, it would take a decade for this journey to come full circle,
                        after having been a
                        teacher for the past 12 years. Shaping young minds has been a treat, but change is healthy. I
                        now chart a course towards
                        a new horizon, fueled by my determination to delve into the realm of software development and to
                        expand my skill set.

                        Alongside my professional pursuits, my interests are as eclectic as my story. From sipping a
                        good cup of tea and trying
                        out new tantalising vegan recipes, to running and traversing nature's trails, my passions
                        encompass a spectrum that
                        harmonises my love for the outdoors and a commitment to advocating for environmental and social
                        justice causes. With a
                        profound zest for exploration, my extensive travels to over 20 countries have kindled a deep
                        appreciation for our planet
                        and diverse cultures, echoing my enthusiasm for understanding the intricate threads that connect
                        humanity. ‚ù§Ô∏è
